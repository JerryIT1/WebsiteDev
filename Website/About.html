        <p class='aboutP'>This Project was started by Ryan Mercado, an aspiring Computer Engineer at the University of
          Texas. The project stemmed out of a pre-existing interest in complex fractals, and began in early October as
          an
          idea for a unique type of NFT art. After generating the first hundred fractals, Ryan dove into the intricacies
          of web3, learning everything he would need to make FRACKT a reality. Months of hard work later and the project
          was released to the public, and is soon to be released for sale. The main hope of the project is that people
          see
          the same potential that the team believes in.</p>
